# python_100_days

This is how I started my python journey

I started learning python because I thought it was cool and also it held a lot of potential in future specially for me as i fvked up my life badly.
So for me this is my redemption story too. I hope one day when i achieve my goal i can look back to it and see the beggining of my journey.
